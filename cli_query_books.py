"""
As you can see, the group() decorator works like the command() decorator, but creates a Group object instead which can be given multiple subcommands that can be attached with Group.add_command().
For simple scripts, itâ€™s also possible to automatically attach and create a command by using the Group.command() decorator instead. .
You would then invoke the Group in your setuptools entry points or other invocations.
